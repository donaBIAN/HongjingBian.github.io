				<p>Dear Hiring Manager:</p>
				<p>I am a recent graduating Computer Science student from Dalhousie university, I am confident that I am
					suitable for this job with international design working experience in Malaysia and programming
					experience. As a
					well-known corporation like yours, I hope that I have the honor to be a part of this great team and
					make contributions
					to this company.</p>
				<p>Currently, as a computer science student at Dalhousie University, I have an extensive set of
					programming experiences.
					For example, I have written applications and websites with team members based on the client's
					requirements using react
					native and JavaScript. and I have done class projects using android studio based on the class
					requirements, I have
					debugged and tested code using IntelliJ IDE and android studio with other programmers. Among these
					programming skill
					sets, I also excel at writing websites using Java, JavaScript, Html, CSS, and PHP. And as a Computer
					Science student, I am good at communicating with team members. I am also good at self-learning, as
					we have a lot of
					projects that require
					self-learning skills and cooperation skills, such as programming an application using new languages,
					so we have to learn
					these new languages by ourselves without any help within the tight schedule. And as a programmer is
					not only just coding
					but also needs to cooperate with team members, as most class projects require teamwork, I have known
					how to collaborate
					with team members, and how to deal with conflicts.</p>
				<p>In the 2021/2022 Full terms, I had the chance to apply my ability to self-learn and cooperate with a
					team during class
					when I worked as one of the software development team members with the client (Michael Mac
					Gilivary). This work was
					about developing an application to help pediatric dermatologists determine the proper dosing of
					specific medications for
					their patients, and we have to use new languages (Flutter & Dart) to develop this software in three
					months. So we have
					to learn those languages by ourselves online and figure out the problem when we encounter bugs or
					logical issues,
					besides that, we have used scrum Methodology in our development process so we had a meeting with the
					client (Michael Mac
					Gilivary) to show our results by the end of each iteration (2 weeks), then we would adjust our plans
					and change the code
					based on our client's suggestions, at the end of the three months, we have reached 80% satisfaction.
				</p>
				<p>In my previous experience, with years of experience as a designer , I have learned that how to design
					a
					comfortable user interface and how to design a website using wordpress and how to design logos and
					posters
					with Photoshop and Illustrator. So besides coding I also consider the layout of the web page and
					customers' satisfaction.
				</p>
				<p>I am eager to start my professional career using my talents, I believe that my skills and my previous
					working experiences
					suit this job. I hope that I could have this opportunity to gain more experience and knowledge as a
					programmer. I am
					looking forward to possibly meeting with you and other team members. I have included my resume for
					further
					consideration.</p>
